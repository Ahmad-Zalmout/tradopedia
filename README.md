# Tradopedia

TradeOpedia is a trading platform website which allows the user to trade in the financial 
market and benefits from an intelligent system which will help increase profits. The 
purpose of making this system is to train young investors and help anyone who would 
like to start investing, especially people with no experience in the financial market and it 
is difficult for them to interpret regular trading platforms. Hence, there is no need to 
deposit any money into the wallet; rather, there is a fixed amount of virtual money 
deposited for every user to see how trading translates to profits or losses in the real 
world. This way money is not trapped in huge risks and could unluckily be lost due to 
lack of exposure to the market. 

The intelligent system is based on well tested machine learning algorithms which are 
trained on large datasets that run back to more than 3 decades. The algorithms create 
models that can show predicted prices based on fundamental analysis. Meaning, our 
models are trained on historical prices to study each industry’s fluctuations separately 
to produce such predictions. Rather than studying news headlines and experts’ 
expectations written in articles; which is called sentimental analysis. 

Each user has a fixed amount of virtual money to start using the trading website and test 
his skills on real live data presented on live charts. Also, there exist charts representing 
the predicted prices for each industry that allows the user to have a picturesque idea 
about where the stock is going. Additionally, the website has risk management tool; on 
one hand, it prevents the user from taking huge losses by setting a lower limit in the 
trade and cannot lose more than half of his investment, on the other hand, it prevents 
greedy profits and setting an upper limit to the trade in order to lower the chances of the 
risk of a sudden drop of the stock after a huge rise.
